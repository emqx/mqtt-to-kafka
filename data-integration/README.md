# MQTT to Kafka - Data Integration

Use out-of-the-box data integration provided by EMQX to streaming message into Confluent/Kafka without writing code.

## Prerequisites

- EMQX: 5.0.3+

## Create Rule and Data Integration

Use EMQX REST to create a rule and data integration.

You can refer to [EMQX - Stream Data into Apache Kafka](https://docs.emqx.com/en/enterprise/v5.0/data-integration/data-bridge-kafka.html) for more details. It is a better way to create a data bridge.
